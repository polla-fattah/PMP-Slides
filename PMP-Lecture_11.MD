# Common Tools for PMP

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- **Definition**: Decomposes project scope into manageable tasks.
- **Use**: Establishes a visual hierarchy of tasks, aiding in resource allocation and time estimation.

**Example**: A marketing campaign project where WBS helps break down activities like market research, content creation, and ad deployment.

# Gantt Charts

- **Definition**: Visual timeline representing project tasks over time.
- **Components**: Task durations, dependencies, milestones.

**Example**: Construction project where Gantt charts outline phases like design, permitting, and construction.

## Earned Value Analysis (EVA)

- **Purpose**: Measures project performance against the plan.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: Efficiency of budget usage.
  - **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**: Efficiency of time usage.

**Use Case**: Useful in monitoring and controlling phase to evaluate project health.
